Welcome to the YouServe release for Summer 2016!

There are four things you need to know.

Open Issues
The open issues to work on are found here:

Summer 2016 Release Milestone

Mockups
To work on the issue, you will need access to the mockups, which are hosted on Balsamiq. Sign up for a Balsamiq account then send Eric your username and email address, and we'll give you access to the mockups. The mockups live here: https://youserve.mybalsamiq.com/projects/youservenew/grid

Committing Code
You'll want to commit your code to the "testing" branch, from which, after the issue has been tested, the master branch admin will merge to master and release into production.

Here is the "testing" branch: YouServe Testing

Stack
We are going to be using Ruby on Rails, along with ReactJS and Foundation as the SCSS framework of choice. Here are some highly recommended tutorials to get you going: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/paths/advanced_rails_five_day.html http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/

Feel free to reach out on email: tmutunhire@gmail.com and let me know your thoughts on the project or tasks, or anything related to code or design. Have fun coding!
